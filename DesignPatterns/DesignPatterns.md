# Design Patterns Learning Progress

## ✅ Implemented Patterns:
| #  | Pattern Name       | Status      | Notes |
|----|-------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Factory Method    | ✅ Done     | Implemented in Embedded (ESP32)              |
| 2  | Adapter          | ✅ Done     | Used for interface compatibility             |
| 3  | Bridge           | ✅ Done     | Applied for communication interfaces (UART, I2C) |
| 4  | Singleton        | ✅ Done     | Ensures a single instance of critical components (e.g., system manager) |
| 5  | Observer         | ⏳ Pending   | Enables event-driven programming (useful for sensor data updates) |
| 6  | Strategy         | ⏳ Pending  | Facilitates algorithm swapping at runtime (e.g., different filtering techniques for sensors) |
| 7  | Composite        | ✅ Done | Useful for managing groups of devices as a single unit |
| 8  | Facade           | ⏳ Pending  | Simplifies hardware interactions by providing a unified API |
| 9  | Decorator        | ⏳ Pending  | Adds extra features to existing components dynamically (e.g., logging, security layers) |
| 10 | Flyweight        | ⏳ Pending  | Optimizes memory usage for shared objects (e.g., preallocated buffers for real-time systems) |
| 11 | Proxy            | ⏳ Pending  | Controls access to hardware components (e.g., managing SPI/I2C transactions safely) |
| 12 | State            | ⏳ Pending  |                                                        |
