# Code for Fun 🏂 

Welcome to **Code for Fun**, a creative, practical, and enjoyable playground of coding!  
This repository is where I collect and develop anything that is:

✨ **Fun to build**  
⚙️ **Professional to use**  
🧠 **Educational to learn**  
💡 **Creative in idea and implementation**

Here, you will find a mix of:
- **Design Pattern implementations** in real embedded/IoT systems
- **Professional utilities** such as logging tools and Serial monitoring software
- Any **technique, tool, experiment, or crazy idea** that improves my experience as an embedded and software engineer

If it is **useful**, **smart**, or **just fun** — it belongs here!
